# PERSUADE Bias
- In this project we artificially introduce representation bias to an automatic scoring algorithm by training three LLMs on single-demographic subsets of a larger dataset
- We then use the models to predict error on the more diverse dataset and examine whether there is differential error between demographic groups.

# PERSUADE Corpus
